Storyline overview 

The story takes place in the Kingdom of Aridia, a vast desert kingdom under attack by an ancient entity that has awoken in the Eternal Dunes. Players assume the role of Queen Elara Drakonis, the ruler of Aridia, who must use her elemental mastery, mental power, and insight to uncover the mysteries of the desert and rally her people against the threat. 

Helio Umetris, the kingdom's trusted adviser with elemental magic and archery skills, joins her, as does Mylo Yasujiro, a visiting dignitary or scout who brings valuable knowledge from the outside world. Throughout the story, the player's decisions will shape the future of Aridia, as the kingdom's fate is determined by how they deal with the challenges that lie ahead. 

The Royal Palace, Oasis of Isolde, Eternal Dunes, and undiscovered desert ruins are among the must-see locations. The player will participate in Rites of the Elements, rituals that have an immediate impact on the desert and its inhabitants. The key item, the Crown of Foresight, improves Elara's ability to see into the future, guiding her decisions.

   Locations (need more than 4) 

Royal Palace - The center of the kingdom, where political decisions are made. It serves as Elara's headquarters for planning and gathering information. 

Oasis of Isolde - Named after Queen Elara’s mother, this magnificent oasis is a sanctuary of life amidst the arid desert. Palm trees sway gently around crystal-clear waters, and exotic flora and fauna thrive in this verdant haven. It is said that the waters of Isolde have healing properties, blessed by the kingdom’s ancient deities.   

Eternal Dunes - The vast deserts of Aridia are both beautiful and deadly. These endless dunes shift with the winds, creating an ever-changing landscape that can easily disorient even the most seasoned traveler. Hidden within the sands are ancient ruins and lost treasures, remnants of civilizations long past.   

Undiscovered desert Ruins - Hidden throughout the desert, these ruins contain artifacts and knowledge that may reveal secrets about the ancient entity. 

The Shattered Spire - A half-buried tower in the dunes, crackling with forgotten storm magic. The Ancient Entity is said to have first stirred here. 

Caverns of Ashra - A maze of underground tunnels guarded by monsters that can withstand high temperatures. 

Moon Salt Flats - A reflecting desert plain where elemental forces are amplified during full moon ceremonies. 

The Verdant Rift - A hidden canyon where desert plants bloom unnaturally fast, nourished by an old elemental imbalance. 

Obsidian Gate - A massive locked door hidden beneath black stone, connected directly to the Entity's origin. 

 

 

Items (need as many to make story and game fluent) 

Psychutal Relic: An Item that aids Mylo in eluding mental manipulation 

Map  

Appearance: A weathered parchment etched with changing runes that occasionally rearrange themselves to expose undiscovered passageways. 

Effect: As the player explores ruins or performs rituals, it tracks known places and unlocks secret passageways. 

Gameplay Use: Reduces the likelihood of getting lost in exploration commands (search desert, explore dunes), and occasionally identifies danger zones. 

Crown of Foresight -  

Appearance: A gold circlet with a moving opal that appears to contain shards of the desert sky. 

Effect: Allows Elara to see threads of possible futures. The visions are intense yet imperfect, frequently depicting symbols, emotions, or fragments rather than complete clarity. 

Gameplay Use: Can be enabled before making critical decisions to receive hints or warnings. Overuse depletes Elara's sanity stat. 

Ritual Components -  

Appearance: A collection of sacred powders, gemstones, and relic fragments kept in bone-carved vessels. Each is linked to an element. 

Effect: Required for the Elements' Rites. Without them, rituals can backfire or fail completely. 

Gameplay Use: Consumable item. Using them at the wrong time or location might waste resources and result in cursed effects. 

Desertglass Shard -  

Appearance: A shard of translucent crystal discovered deep within the dunes, gleaming with trapped starlight. When held, subtle whispers resonate through the mind. 

 Legend: These are said to be remnants of an antique mirror that once reflected the desert's spirit. The glass shattered when the Entity was originally sealed. 

 Effect: Improves foresight and perception but drains sanity with time. 

Gameplay Use: Can strengthen the Crown of Foresight's visions but may cause mental instability. 

Scarab Compass - 

Appearance: A bronze scarab pendant with wings that twitch and change like clockwork, always facing the nearest source of power. 

Legend: Designed by priests of the Oasis of Isolde, the scarab was regarded as a guide through storms and illusions. It fails to discern between friend and adversary. 

Effect: Directs the bearer to the strongest magical presence in the region. 

Gameplay Application: Aids in the discovery of hidden ruins or opponents, but may inadvertently lead to disaster. 

Sunford Dagger -  

Appearance: A slender, curving sword made from tempered desert iron that glows faintly in stored sunlight. Its edge flames brightly in conflict.  

Legend: Once wielded by the warrior-king Ragnar Drakonis, who was said to channel the desert sun itself through the blade during battle. 

Effect: Channels sun fire, which is destructive against shadow and sand creatures but less effective against water or earth beings. 

Gameplay Use: Elara or Helio can use this fighting relic to gain an advantage over corrupted foes. 

Echo Vial - 

Appearance: A crystal bottle covered in silver, which sparkles slightly when near voices. Once uncorked, it emits the sound it has stored. 

Legend: Originally used by desert oracles to keep holy mantras. Some claim that they can record the dying person's final remarks. 

Effect: Voices can be stored and replayed to deceive, inspire, or unlock sound-based wards. 

Gameplay Use: Diplomacy, unlocking boundaries, and fooling foes are all possible gameplay applications. 

Veil of Isolde -  

Appearance: A translucent silky veil that changes hue like desert sunrise. When worn, it feels chilly against the skin, as if offering protection. 

Legend: It belonged to Queen Isolde Drakonis. It was sanctified by the desert deities to protect her from evil whispers during her rule. 

Effect: Prevents mental influence and fear-based magic. 

Gameplay Use: Enhances Elara's mind control skills and protects her from corruption by the Ancient Entity.
